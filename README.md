Secretary
======
Secretary is a CraftBukkit plugin that allows you to set and manage todo lists and reminders using a villager masquerading as a secretary.

As a player, you can:
* Create new secretaries with a nice help desk (so they don't run away)
* Add, list, mark and delete todo items with a command.
* List todos by right-clicking on the secretary with PAPER
* Add and list repeating and non-repeating reminders with alarms by command
* List reminders by right-clicking on the secretary with an INK SACK
* Change the alarm sound for reminders.

As an admin, you can:
* Set a limit for the number of secretaries allowed per player
* Set limits for the number of todos and reminders per secretary
* Set whether the secretary takes no damage for a specified period
* Set whether player must have the 'help desk' materials in their inventory before they can create a secretary
